I learnt such dangerous mistake in SQL system, and it can be also in my system applications.
The mistake is to put incorrect data type in tables. F.x If we put something to get inout using "Varchar"
we have to be very careful and do all checks when user will input something. Varchar can get any symbols, user can input
remove all tables in window where f.x needed only username, his input can crash all database system.

In my sql I am trying to be very careful to get user input to avoid such mistakes
