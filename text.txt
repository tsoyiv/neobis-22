The idea is that you can remotely manage/run projects
that you want to run on another device. In this case,
Docker will help you. Thanks to the creation of the image,
you can run the project through the docker itself, which will
provide you with work with your project. At the beginning, .jar file is being created,
then its structure is transferred to the docker itself, which, thanks to this file,
helps to run the project on its server.
